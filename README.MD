# Big O Notation Playground

## 📚 Introduction

This playground is my personal space to explore and understand Big O notation. Here, I experiment with how Big O works and learn to apply it in real-world programming scenarios.

## 🧮 What is Big O Notation?

Big O notation characterizes functions according to their growth rates. Different algorithms may be more efficient in different situations. Understanding Big O helps you choose the right algorithm for your specific needs.

| Notation   | Name         | Description                                            |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| O(1)       | Constant     | Execution time stays the same regardless of input size |
| O(log n)   | Logarithmic  | Execution time grows logarithmically with input size   |
| O(n)       | Linear       | Execution time grows linearly with input size          |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Combination of linear and logarithmic growth           |
| O(n²)      | Quadratic    | Execution time grows quadratically with input size     |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)

## 🔍 How to Use the Playground

Run each example to observe how different algorithms perform with the same input size:

```bash
# Javascript
node javascript/1-O1_constant.js
node javascript/2-OlogN_binary_search.js
node javascript/3-On_linear_scan.js
node javascript/4-OnLogN_merge_sort.js
node javascript/5-On2_naive_pairs.js

# Golang
# ( Coming Soon )

# PHP ( Coming Soon )
# ( Coming Soon )

```

### Experiment with Different Input Sizes

To truly understand Big O notation, try modifying the N value in each script (make it 10× bigger or smaller) and observe how the execution time changes:

- O(1) : Execution time barely changes regardless of input size
- O(log n) : Execution time grows very slowly (doubling N only adds one more iteration)
- O(n) : Execution time doubles when input size doubles
- O(n log n) : Execution time grows slightly faster than linear (watch what happens when you compare 100k vs 200k elements)
- O(n²) : Execution time grows dramatically (doubling N makes it approximately 4× slower)

## 🧠 Why Big O Matters

Understanding Big O notation helps you:

1. Predict Performance : Anticipate how your code will perform with large inputs
2. Compare Algorithms : Choose the most efficient solution for your specific problem
3. Optimize Code : Identify and eliminate inefficient patterns in your code
4. Technical Interviews : Discuss algorithm efficiency in a standardized way
